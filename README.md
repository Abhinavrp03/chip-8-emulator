# Task 1-chip-8-emulator
A CHIP-8 Emulator code written in Python using Pygame
# Task 2-Discord Bot
Task 2 has not been done because my knowledge to this topic is yet to be explored and learned,but from what I have researched and after getting a strong foundation
I would proceed by installing the necessary libraries such as discord.py for setting up a connection between discord then I would import two more libraries such as 
python-dotenv and aiohttp to manage bot token and for api calls respectievly,After the basic set ups I would then proceed to outline the bot structure and work toward installing core functions.
